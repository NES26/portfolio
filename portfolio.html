        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <P>The picture above does not exactly say who i am. there is a trick here, because as you know if someone tells you they are parrots, that would mean they talk too much, right? In this case for myself this means that i dont talk that much, i am a quiet person or so i believe but i love being around people who speak a lot so my job would be to listen. that is my character but i learnt how to make good use of it in that i get to learn more and ask questions when necessary. By listening you can learn a lot about many things in any given environment and its a good skill too,</P><div class="parrots"></div>
